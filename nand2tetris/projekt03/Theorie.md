- memory elements are built ffrom sequential chips
- flip flops
	- use of variant called data flip-flop (DFF)
	- one single bit data input
	- one clock input - value of master clock
	- one single bit data output
	- out(t) = function(in(t-1)) --outputs input from previous time unit (time unit is modeled by clock cyle of master clock)
- time is represented by a master clock
	- delivers alternating singnal - oscillator
	- alternates between two phases 
	- elapsed time between beginning of first phase and ending of second phase is called cycle
	- current clock phase is represented by a binary unit and broacast to every chip
- Register
	- out(t) = function(in(t-1))
	- Mulltiplexor + DFF = 1 bit register
	- multi bit register built by single bit register as array
	- this multi bit registers are called words
- memories
	- RAM can be buit by stacking such registers
	- Random Access Memory - read/write operations on RAM should be able to access randomly chosen words
